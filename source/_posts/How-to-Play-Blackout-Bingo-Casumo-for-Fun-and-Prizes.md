#  How to Play Blackout Bingo Casumo for Fun and Prizes

Blackout Bingo is a fun and exciting game that can be played at Casumo for both prizes and fun. In this guide, we will cover everything you need to know about playing Blackout Bingo at Casumo, including how to play, the different rounds and the best strategies for winning.

So, what is Blackout Bingo? Blackout Bingo is a game where players attempt to cover all 25 squares on their bingo card in order to win. The game is played in rounds, with each round consisting of a certain amount of numbers being called. The player who covers all 25 squares first wins the round.

The game can be played with either one or two cards, and each card has five rows and five columns. There are 25 squares in total on each card. The numbers that are called during each round are chosen at random, so there is no way to predict which squares will be called.

The object of the game is to cover as many squares as possible on your card before your opponents do. The first player to cover all 25 squares on their card wins the round. If there is more than one player who covers all 25 squares on their card, then the player with the most covering squares in total wins the round. If there is still a tie, then the player who covered their last square first wins the round.

There are six rounds in total in Blackout Bingo, with each round consisting of a certain number of numbers being called. In general, the later rounds have more numbers called than the earlier rounds. Here is a breakdown of how many numbers are called in each round:

Round 1 – 5 numbers called
Round 2 – 6 numbers called
Round 3 – 7 numbers called
Round 4 – 8 numbers called
Round 5 – 9 numbers called
Round 6 – 10 numbers called

Blackout Bingo is one of the most popular games at Casumo. It is easy to learn and offers plenty of excitement for players. The game is played with a standard deck of cards, and each player is dealt five cards. There are also six squares drawn on a sheet of paper, called the blackout sheet. The object of the game is to fill in all six squares on the blackout sheet.

The first player starts by flipping over the top card of their deck. They then place this card in the center of the table. If any other player has a card that matches this card, they must place it on top of the first card. If they have more than one matching card, they must put all of them on top of the first card. This process continues until no player has any matching cards left in their hand. At this point, the player who flipped over the first card takes another turn.

If you can't place any more cards, you draw from the deck until you can play again. The winner is the first player to fill in all six squares on their blackout sheet.
