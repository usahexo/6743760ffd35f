#  When performed sports betting begin American League West, lucrative opportunities abound!

There are many different sports that people can bet on, but the MLB is a great place to start for those new to sports betting. The American League West is a particularly lucrative division to bet on because there are so many evenly matched teams. In this article, we will take a look at each of the teams in the AL West and examine the likelihood of them winning the division.

The Houston Astros are the clear favorites to win the AL West. They are led by superstar Carlos Correa and have one of the most potent lineups in all of baseball. The only thing that could stop them from winning the division is an injury to one of their key players.

The Los Angeles Angels are a good team, but they are not quite on Houston’s level. Still, they have a chance to win if they play well throughout the season.

The Seattle Mariners had a rough year last season, but they should be back in contention this year. They have some good players and should be able to compete with anyone in the AL West.

The Oakland Athletics had a breakout year last season and surprised many people by winning 75 games. This year, they will need to do even better if they want to compete with Houston and Los Angeles.

Finally, we have the Texas Rangers. This team is in rebuilding mode and is not likely to compete for the division championship this year.

#  When performed sports betting begin American League West, make sure to have a sharp eye on the underdog!

There are a few teams in the American League West that people may not consider when placing their bets, but they can provide great value as underdogs. The Oakland Athletics and Seattle Mariners both have the potential to give the top teams in the division a run for their money.

The Athletics had a surprising season in 2017, finishing third in the division with 75 wins. They have made some key additions to their roster this offseason and could be even better in 2018. The Mariners also had a strong 2017 season, finishing fourth in the division with 86 wins. They added some key players this offseason and should be contenders once again this year.

These two teams may be overlooked by many bettors, but they have the potential to pull off some big upset victories. If you're looking for value betting options in the American League West, make sure to keep an eye on the Athletics and Mariners.

#  When performed sports betting begin American League West, an in-depth knowledge of the teams is critical!

A well-informed decision can result in much higher payouts and make the overall experience much more enjoyable. The first step is understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each team. 

Let’s take a look at the teams in this division:
Houston Astros: they had an incredible 2017 season and are considered one of the favorites to win the World Series this year. Their offense is led by Jose Altuve, Carlos Correa, and George Springer. The starting pitching staff is anchored by Justin Verlander and Dallas Keuchel.

Los Angeles Angels: Mike Trout is their biggest star and is coming off another MVP-caliber season. They have a deep lineup and some very good starting pitchers.

Oakland Athletics: they are always a dark horse in the race, as they tend to be very streaky from one year to the next. They have some young talent that could breakout this year, such as Matt Chapman and Matt Olson.

Seattle Mariners: Robinson Cano has departed but they still have Nelson Cruz, Jean Segura, and Kyle Seager. They have a new manager in Scott Servais this year and he will need to get more out of their pitching staff if they want to contend. 

Texas Rangers: Adrian Beltre is still going strong at age 39 and is their best player. They lost Yu Darvish to free agency but have added Cole Hamels to their rotation. 
Now that we’ve overviewed all of the teams, let’s take a closer look at how each one stacks up against each other. 

 

 *Houston Astros* The Astros are definitely the team to beat in this division. They had an incredible 2017 season and are considered one of the favorites to win the World Series this year. Their offense is led by Jose Altuve, Carlos Correa, and George Springer. The starting pitching staff is anchored by Justin Verlander and Dallas Keuchel (who both won Cy Young Awards last year). If they stay healthy, there’s no reason why they can’t repeat as division champions. 

 *Los Angeles Angels* The Angels are close behind the Astros in terms of talent level. Mike Trout is their biggest star and is coming off another MVP-caliber season. They have a deep lineup and some very good starting pitchers (such as Garrett Richards, Tyler Skaggs, Andrew Heaney). It will be interesting to see how they perform without Joe Maddon managing them (he left to manage Tampa Bay). 

 *Oakland Athletics* The Athletics are always a dark horse in the race, as they tend to be very streaky from one year to the next. They have some young talent that could breakout this year, such as Matt Chapman (3B) and Matt Olson (1B). Kendall Graveman anchors their rotation but it remains to be seen if he can pitch well over an extended period of time. 

*Seattle Mariners* Robinson Cano has departed but they still have Nelson Cruz (OF), Jean Segura (SS), and Kyle Seager (3B). They have a new manager in Scott Servais this year and he will need to get more out of their pitching staff if they want to contend for a playoff spot. Felix Hernandez had a down year last season but may rebound in 2018; Hisashi Iwakuma also returns after missing most of last season with injury. 

*Texas Rangers* Adrian Beltre (3B) is still going strong at age 39 and is their best player. They lost Yu Darvish (starting pitcher) to free agency but have added Cole Hamels (starting pitcher) to their rotation. Hamels has been inconsistent over the past few seasons but should be able to provide some stability for them until they can find someone else long-term

Houston Astros -1.5 (-190)

The Texas Rangers open up their home schedule against their in-state rivals, the Houston Astros. The Rangers are coming off a 94-loss season and are underdogs in this matchup. Shin-Soo Choo is recovering from injury but is expected to be ready for the opener. The Astros bring back most of their 2017 World Series Championship team and are expected to be one of the top teams in the AL West once again. This should be an exciting matchup, with the Astros favored by 1.5 runs.

Friday, April 6 
Los Angeles Angels at Oakland Athletics - 10:35 PM ET 
Los Angeles Angels +1.5 (-175) 
Oakland Athletics -1.5 (+155) 

The Los Angeles Angels begin their season on the road against the Oakland Athletics. The A’s finished last in the AL West last season but made some key offseason moves including signing Jonathan Lucroy and Stephen Piscotty. The Angels bring back much of their same team from last year and are favorites in this matchup by 1.5 runs. This should be a good game to watch late Friday night!

Betting on sports is one of the oldest pastimes in the world. People have been placing bets on sporting events for centuries, and the practice has only grown more popular in recent years. In the United States, betting on sports is a multi-billion dollar industry, and there are countless people who enjoy making wagers on their favorite teams and athletes.

When it comes to betting on sports, there are a variety of different options available to you. You can bet on individual games, or you can place bets on the outcomes of entire seasons or tournaments. You can also place prop bets on specific events within a game, such as how many touchdowns a player will score or whether a team will win by a certain number of points.

No matter what type of bet you choose to make, it's important to do your research first. Make sure you know as much as possible about the teams and players involved in the game you're betting on. This will give you a better chance of making accurate predictions and winning money.

If you're new to sports betting, it's also important to learn about the different types of odds available at online sportsbooks. The most common type of odds are fractions, which are expressed as numbers like 5/1 or 2/7. These odds tell you how much you stand to win if you bet $1 (or whatever your currency is).

Another common type of odds is decimal odds, which are expressed as numbers like 1.5 or 3.2. Decimal odds tell you how much money you would receive if you bet $1 (again, depending on the currency). For example, if you placed a bet at decimal odds of 1.5 and won, you would receive $1.50 back plus your original stake ($1 + $1.50 = $2.50).

There are also American odds available at some sportsbooks. American odds work differently from fractions and decimals, so it's important to understand how they work before placing any bets using this type of odds format. Generally speaking, American odds represent how likely it is that an event will happen (e.g., -200 indicates that an event is very likely not to happen).

Once you've familiarized yourself with the different types of odds available, it's time to start betting! There are a variety of great online sportsbooks where you can place your bets, so be sure to check out some of these sites before making any decisions. Some popular options include BetOnline, SportsBettingAG, and Bovada Sportsbook.

No matter which site(s) you choose to use, always be sure to read the terms and conditions before opening an account or placing any bets. This will help ensure that you understand how each site works and what kinds of bets are allowed. It's also important to make sure that the site is reputable and has a good reputation for paying out winnings promptly.
