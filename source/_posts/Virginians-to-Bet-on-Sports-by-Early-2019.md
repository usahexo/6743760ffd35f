#  Virginians to Bet on Sports by Early 2019

According to a report released by the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (VDACS), Virginians will be able to bet on sports before the end of 2019.

The report, compiled by the agency's Racing and Gaming Division, says that lawmakers must pass legislation authorizing sports betting before it can be offered in the state.

"If the General Assembly desires to authorize sports betting in Virginia, legislation must be introduced and passed in order for regulations to be developed and for the activity to commence," said Brian W. Lee, Director of the Racing and Gaming Division. "If that occurs in our current session which concludes on February 8th2019, Virginians could place bets on sporting events before the end of the year."

Lee added that his agency is ready to implement sports betting if lawmakers approve it. "Should the Commonwealth of Virginia decide to authorize sports betting, my division stands ready to implement regulations that would ensure its integrity and protect consumers," he said.

The VDACS report comes as several other states have moved ahead with legalizing sports betting. In December 2018, New Jersey became the first state to allow sports betting outside of Nevada. Since then, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Mississippi, West Virginia, and Rhode Island have also legalized sports betting.

Governor Ralph Northam has not indicated whether he supports legalizing sports betting in Virginia. However, House Speaker Kirk Cox has said he is open to considering such a proposal.

#  State Approves wagers on College and Pro Games

A measure permitting bets on college and professional sports contests won easy approval from the Connecticut House of Representatives last week. The bill, which allows wagers at casinos, race tracks and online, now moves to the Senate for consideration.

“I think it’s great that people can have some fun and make a little money on the games they’re interested in,” said Rep. Edwin Vargas, the Hartford Democrat who co-sponsored the bill.

According to the American Gaming Association, there are an estimated $150 billion wagered each year on sports in the United States, most illegally. Nevada is the only state where single-game sports betting is legal.

If approved by the full legislature and signed into law by Gov. Dannel Malloy, Connecticut would become the second state after New Jersey to offer full-scale sports betting. Under a federal law passed in 1992, states are allowed to offer such betting if it is conducted within their borders.

The Connecticut measure would allow bets on professional and college football, basketball, baseball, hockey and auto racing. Bets could also be placed on other sporting events including golf and soccer but would not be allowed on high school or amateur competitions.

To place a bet at a casino or racetrack, customers would have to present valid identification proving they are at least 21 years old. They could also place bets online but would have to physically be in Connecticut to collect any winnings.

Casinos would keep 6.5 percent of all wagers as commissions; race tracks would keep 10 percent; and online betting operators would keep 12 percent. The state would get 25 percent of all commissions collected as well as half of all fees paid by online betting operators.

#  In-state Residents Can Bet at Local Casinos Starting Next Month

Residents of Pennsylvania will be able to place bets at the state’s casinos starting next month. The move was made in order to help bolster the state’s budget, which has been in a precarious position in recent years.

The original proposal would have allowed residents to place bets online, but that was eventually scrapped due to concerns that it would not generate enough revenue. Casinos will now be responsible for taking bets from customers at their establishments.

The decision has been met with mixed reactions, with some people arguing that it will lead to more problems gambling addiction, while others believe that it will be a major boon for the state’s economy. Regardless of where people stand on the issue, there is no doubt that the new law will have a significant impact on Pennsylvanians.

It is still unclear exactly how much money the state expects to make from legalized gambling, but officials are confident that it will be a major help in plugging the budget deficit. In fact, some lawmakers are already calling for additional casinos to be opened in an effort to increase revenue even further.

As states across the country look for ways to supplement their budgets, it is likely that more and more of them will turn to gambling as a way to raise money. This could have a major impact on the gambling industry as a whole, and it will be interesting to see how things play out in the coming years.

#  Gambling Anticipation in Virginia Booming Ahead of September Launch

As September inches closer, Virginia is gearing up for the launch of gambling anticipation is already booming. With three casinos and a slot machine parlor set to open their doors, the Old Dominion is expected to earn more than $1 billion in gambling revenue in 2019. This number is especially impressive when you consider that the Commonwealth brought in a little over $900 million in 2018.

The arrival of gambling has already impacted the state's economy. In June, just ahead of the rollout of casino gambling, officials reported that nearly 2,000 new jobs were created in the hospitality industry. Restaurants, bars, and other businesses catering to tourists are expecting a surge in business with the opening of the casinos.

While opinions about gambling vary, there's no doubt that it will provide a significant boost to Virginia's economy. And with three new casinos set to open in September, there's plenty of excitement in the air as Virginians prepare to take their chances at the slots and tables.

#  Virginians Get Ready to Place Their Bets on the Season

The Virginia General Assembly convenes on January 9, and there is plenty of excitement in the air. Legislators will be getting down to business, and one of the items on their agenda is whether to legalize wagers on professional and collegiate sporting events.

The Commonwealth has been losing out on millions of dollars in potential tax revenue every year, as people place illegal bets with bookies or offshore operators. The proposed legislation would allow for betting at land-based casinos, horse tracks, and off-track betting facilities.

Supporters of the measure say that it would create jobs and generate much-needed revenue for the state. They argue that it is time for Virginia to join the majority of states that have already legalized sports betting.

Opponents, however, are concerned about the potential social ills that could come with increased gambling. They worry that it could lead to addiction and financial ruin for many people.

It remains to be seen whether the legislation will pass, but Virginians are certainly eager to place their bets on the upcoming season!
