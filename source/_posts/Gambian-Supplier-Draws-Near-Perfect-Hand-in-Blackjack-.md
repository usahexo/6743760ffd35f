#  Gambian Supplier Draws Near Perfect Hand in Blackjack 

Gamblers the world over are always on the lookout for a good blackjack game. The thrill and anticipation of gambling have people coming back time and again to casinos in the hopes of winning big. For those who know what they're doing, blackjack can be a very lucrative game. But there are also those who make costly mistakes that can quickly erase any profits they may have made.

One Gambian man, who will remain anonymous, has apparently found the perfect blackjack strategy. This individual has reportedly been making consistent profits at the casino by following a very specific pattern. According to sources, this gambler always splits 10s and stands on 17s. In addition, he never doubles down and only bets one unit per hand.

This approach may seem simple enough, but it's actually quite difficult to execute correctly. Many gamblers make the mistake of splitting 8s or hitting on 16, which can lead to disastrous results. The Gambian man's near perfect strategy is thus all the more impressive.

So far, this gambler has managed to win over $2,000 in a single night by using his method. And while there's no guarantee that he'll continue to win in the future, his current streak is definitely impressive. If you're looking to improve your blackjack skills, you could certainly do worse than follow this man's lead.
