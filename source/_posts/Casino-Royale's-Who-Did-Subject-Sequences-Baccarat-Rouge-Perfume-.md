#  Casino Royale's Who Did Subject Sequences Baccarat Rouge Perfume? 

In the 2006 James Bond film Casino Royale, Agent 007 (Daniel Craig) faces off against the nefarious Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen) in a high-stakes game of baccarat. But what perfume does Le Chiffre wear?

Some fans of the film believe that Le Chiffre wears Baccarat Rouge, a fragrance created by French luxury goods company Louis Vuitton. The scent is said to be woodsy and spicy, perfect for a cold winter night like the one depicted in Casino Royale.

Others believe that Le Chiffre wears Perfume by Jean Paul Gaultier. This fragrance is classified as a floral oriental scent, with top notes of orange blossom and ginger, middle notes of jasmine and rose, and base notes of vanilla, amber, and musk. It's a sensual fragrance that could certainly fit the bill for a character as mysterious as Le Chiffre.

So who's right? Did Daniel Craig's Bond really face off against Mads Mikkelsen's Le Chiffre in a baccarat game while he was wearing Baccarat Rouge or Perfume? We may never know for sure. But either way, it's an interesting piece of trivia to bring up next time you're playing cards with your friends!
