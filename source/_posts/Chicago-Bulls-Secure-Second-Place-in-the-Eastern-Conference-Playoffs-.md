#  Chicago Bulls Secure Second Place in the Eastern Conference Playoffs 

After a thrilling overtime victory against the Miami Heat on Sunday, the Chicago Bulls have clinched second place in the Eastern Conference. The 103-96 victory marked the team’s 47th win of the season, surpassing their total from last year. This also secures home-court advantage in the first round of the playoffs.

Led by Jimmy Butler and Pau Gasol, the Bulls were able to overcome an early double-digit deficit to take control of the game in the fourth quarter. Butler finished with 28 points, while Gasol tallied 14 points and 11 rebounds. The Heat had no answer for Chicago down the stretch, as they were outscored 26-14 in overtime.

The Bulls now await the winner of the Brooklyn Nets-Atlanta Hawks series. If Atlanta advances, Chicago will travel to Philips Arena for Game 1 on Sunday. If Brooklyn wins, the series will start at United Center on Saturday.

#  Chicago Bulls Heading into NBA Playoffs as the Sixth Seed 

The Chicago Bulls are heading into the NBA Playoffs as the sixth seed. Currently, they are in fourth place in the Eastern Conference. With four games remaining in their regular season, they are looking to close out strong and head into the Playoffs with momentum.

Their first round opponent is yet to be determined, but it is looking like it could either be the Miami Heat or the Milwaukee Bucks. The Bulls have had a tough season, but they are heading into the Playoffs with some good players and a lot of potential.

Injuries have been a big issue for them this year, but they have been able to overcome them for the most part. Some of their key players include Lauri Markkanen, Zach LaVine, and Kris Dunn. They will need to continue playing well if they want to make a run at the NBA Finals.

It won't be easy going against either the Heat or Bucks, but they have shown that they can compete with anyone. It will be interesting to see how they perform in the Playoffs and whether or not they can make it all the way to the Finals.

#  Cleveland Cavaliers vs Chicago Bulls: Betting Preview and Prediction 

The Cleveland Cavaliers (32-22) will visit the Chicago Bulls (23-31) on Thursday night. The Cavs are coming off a 102-95 victory over the Detroit Pistons, while the Bulls lost to the Oklahoma City Thunder 114-112.

The Cavaliers are 3.5-point favorites in this game, and they are 8-3 against the spread in their last 11 games. The Bulls are 5-1 against the spread in their last six home games.

The Cavaliers have been one of the best teams in the NBA this season, and they have been especially good on the road. They have averaged 112.8 points per game on the road this season, and they have shot 49.1 percent from the field and 36.4 percent from three-point range. LeBron James has been playing extremely well lately, and he is averaging 30.8 points, 9.0 rebounds, 7.5 assists, 2.3 steals and 1.0 blocks over his last five games.

The Bulls have been playing much better lately, but they are still not as good as the Cavaliers. They have averaged 107.3 points per game at home this season, and they have shot 47.5 percent from the field and 35 percent from three-point range. Jimmy Butler has been particularly good lately, averaging 27 points, 6 rebounds, 5 assists and 2 steals over his last five games.

I expect the Cavaliers to win this game easily by at least 10 points. They are simply a much better team than the Bulls right now, and they should be able to take advantage of Chicago’s defense

#  Chicago Bulls and Miami Heat to Bet On in Latest Odds? 

The Chicago Bulls (1.50) and Miami Heat (2.50) are among the favorites in the latest odds to win the 2017-18 NBA championship, according to oddsmakers at the Westgate Las Vegas SuperBook.

However, it may be worth betting on the Oklahoma City Thunder (5.00), who are looking like a much better value at this point according to the odds. The Thunder have been one of the most impressive teams in the early going this season, led by MVP candidate Russell Westbrook.

Westbrook is averaging a triple double for the season, and he has help from fellow All-Stars Paul George and Carmelo Anthony. The combination of Westbrook, George and Anthony is as good as any in the NBA, and they should be able to make a deep run in the playoffs if they can stay healthy.

The Bulls, meanwhile, have been struggling without superstar guard Dwyane Wade. Wade left Chicago in free agency during the offseason and signed with the Heat, leaving Jimmy Butler as the team’s go-to guy. Butler is a very good player, but he’s not quite on Wade’s level.

The Heat also lost several other players in free agency, includingguard Dion Waitersand forward Luke Babbitt. They have been replaced by Kelly Olynyk and Bam Adebayo, who are both talented but unproven players.

The Thunder should be able to beat either team in a seven-game series, and they offer great value at 5.00 given their current form.

#  NBA Playoffs: Expert Picks Against The Spread

The NBA Playoffs have finally arrived and everyone has their opinions on who will come out on top. But when it comes to betting against the spread, it can be hard to know who to trust. In this article, we’ll take a look at five experts who have a proven track record of picking games against the spread and give you their thoughts on this year’s playoffs.

First up is ESPN’s Zach Lowe. Lowe is one of the most respected basketball writers in the business and he’s had success picking games against the spread in the past. This year, Lowe is predicting that the Golden State Warriors will win the championship with a record of 15-1. He’s also picking the Houston Rockets to reach the Finals, while surprisingly picking the Cleveland Cavaliers to lose in Round One.

Next up is FiveThirtyEight’s Nate Silver. Silver is another well-respected pundit and he has a strong track record of picking games against the spread. This year, Silver predicts that the Warriors will win it all with a record of 16-1. He also has Golden State reaching the Finals, but he has the Boston Celtics upsetting them in the Eastern Conference Finals.

At CBS Sports, Bruce Feldman is predicting that the Warriors will only go 14-2 in this year’s playoffs and foresees a potential upset by LeBron James and company in Round One. Feldman also has Houston reaching the Finals but losing to Golden State in six games.

Over at Bleacher Report, Ken Berger thinks that Houston is going to come out on top this year with a record of 17-0. He has Golden State losing in Round Two to Oklahoma City and Cleveland losing to Toronto in Round One.

Finally, we have The New York Times’ Benjamin Hoffman who believes that Houston will finish with a perfect postseason record of 18-0. He has Golden State losing again in Round Two this time to San Antonio while Cleveland loses to Boston in Round One.
