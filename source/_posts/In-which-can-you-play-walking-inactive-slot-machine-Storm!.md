#  What are the odds of winning on the walking inactive slot machine in Storm?

There is no definitive answer to this question as it largely depends on the luck of the player. However, there are some general rules that can be applied in order to increase the chances of winning on this type of slot machine.

Firstly, it is important to note that the walking inactive slot machine in Storm offers much better odds than most other slot machines in the game. With this in mind, players should aim to wager as much as they can afford on each spin in order to maximise their potential rewards.

Secondly, it is also important to familiarise oneself with the different symbols that feature on the reels of the walking inactive slot machine. Generally, the most valuable symbols are those that depict different items such as gems or treasure chests. In order to improve one's chances of winning, it is therefore recommended that players bet on these symbols whenever possible.

Lastly, players should avoid betting on any symbol that has already appeared several times during a single session. This is because there is a higher likelihood that this symbol will not appear again for some time, resulting in a loss of funds.
