Next, select the perfume oil option rather than the spray bottle. This is because perfume oils last longer than sprays, and they also produce a stronger scent. You'll also need an atomizer or dropper so that you can apply the oil to your skin.

Once you have all of these items, it's time to add baccarat rouge Zola to your wardrobe! Simply unscrew the cap of the atomizer/dropper, place 3-4 drops of oil into the container, and then spray it onto your skin.
