Are you finding it difficult to beat the Lv. 60 dungeon roulette in Ragnarok Online? Do not worry, as this guide is here to help you!

The first step is to make sure that your party is well-prepared. This means that your party should be composed of a tank, a healer, and three damage-dealers.

The first thing you want to do is aggro all of the enemies and then pull them back to one spot. Doing this will make it easier for your party to take them down one at a time. Have your tank take the lead and keep the enemies focused on him while the damage-dealers unleash their fury from behind. The healer should stay close to the tank in case anyone needs healing and use her spells wisely.

With enough DPS (damage per second) and proper tactics, you should be able to easily beat the Lv. 60 dungeon roulette in Ragnarok Online!
