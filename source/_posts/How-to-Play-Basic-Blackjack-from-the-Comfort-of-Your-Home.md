#  How to Play Basic Blackjack from the Comfort of Your Home

Blackjack is one of the most popular casino games in the world, and for good reason. The game is easy to learn but can be complex to play, which makes it a perfect choice for gambling novices and experienced players alike. If you’re interested in learning how to play blackjack from the comfort of your home, here’s a quick guide on the basics of the game.

To begin, each player is dealt two cards face-up, and the dealer is dealt one card face-up and one card face-down. The aim of blackjack is to beat the dealer’s hand by either getting as close to 21 as possible or by having a higher total than the dealer without going over 21. In order to do this, players can either hit (take another card) or stand (end their turn).

If your hand exceeds 21, you automatically lose regardless of what the dealer has. In addition, if you hit and bust (go over 21), you also lose automatically. As such, it’s important to exercise caution when deciding whether or not to hit, particularly if your hand is close to 21.

The other key rules of blackjack are that Aces count as 1 or 11 points depending on what you need, and Kings, Queens and Jacks all count as 10 points. So, for example, if you were dealt an Ace and a 3, your total would be 14 points (Ace = 1 + 3 = 4; 4 + 10 = 14).

Once both players have finished their turns, the dealer reveals their second card and completes their hand. If the dealer has 17 or more points total, they must stand regardless of what the players have done. If the dealer has 16 points or less however, they must draw another card (one more). If the drawn card equals or beats the player’s total hand value then they lose (even if they had already stood), but if their total hand value beats that of the dealer then they win money. The amount won depends on how much money was wagered by both players at the beginning of the hand.

As you can see then, blackjack is a relatively straightforward game once you understand the basic rules. So why not give it a try next time you want a taste of casino action without leaving your home?
