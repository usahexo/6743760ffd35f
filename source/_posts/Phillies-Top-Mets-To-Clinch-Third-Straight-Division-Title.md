#  Phillies Top Mets To Clinch Third Straight Division Title

The Phillies clinched their third straight NL East Division title with a 7-5 victory over the Mets on Tuesday night at Citi Field.

Philadelphia entered the day with a magic number of two to clinch the division, and they took care of business against their Met rivals.

Rhys Hoskins led the way for the Phillies offensively, going 2-for-3 with a home run, four RBIs, and two runs scored.

Mets starter Marcus Stroman was roughed up early, allowing six runs (five earned) over 4 2/3 innings.

Zack Wheeler pitched well in relief for New York, allowing just one run over 5 1/3 innings, but it wasn't enough as the Phillies held on for the victory.

#  Dobbs, Utley Homer In Five-Run Ninth To Lead Phillies Over Nationals

PHILADELPHIA -- Chase Utley and Ryan Howard hit back-to-back homers in the bottom of the ninth inning to lead the Philadelphia Phillies over the Washington Nationals 5-4 on Monday night.

Utley and Howard each finished with three hits for Philadelphia, which has won four of six.

Drew Storen (1-2) started the ninth for Washington but was lifted after yielding a one-out single to Utley. Tyler Clippard came on and gave up a double to Jimmy Rollins before Howard crushed his 15th home run of the season into the second row of seats in left field to give the Phillies a 5-4 lead.

Jonathan Papelbon pitched a scoreless ninth for his 18th save.

The Phillies took a 4-3 lead in the eighth on Utley's two-run single off Jerry Blevins. The Nationals tied it in the top of the ninth on Ian Desmond's two-run homer off Papelbon.

#  Howard Drives In Four, Phillies Hold Off Cardinals

PHILADELPHIA (AP) 
Howard drove in four runs, including a three-run homer, to lead the Philadelphia Phillies to an 8-5 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals on Wednesday night.
The Phillies bullpen was shaky but held on for the win as Jake Diekman got the last two outs for his first major league save.
"Anytime you can beat a team like that it's a good feeling," Howard said. "They're one of the best in the National League."
The Cardinals have now lost six of their last eight games.
Howard's three-run shot off Jaime Garcia (6-7) in the fourth inning gave Philadelphia a 5-2 lead. He added an RBI single in the sixth.
"I'm just trying to do my part and help out any way I can," Howard said.
 Chase Utley had three hits and scored twice for Philadelphia, which has won five of its last six games.

#  Hamels Gets revenge, Phils take series from Braves




Less than 24 hours after Cole Hamels surrendered eight earned runs to the Braves in Atlanta, he got revenge on his former team. Hamels struck out 10 batters and allowed just two hits over eight innings as the Phillies took the series finale 3-0.

The victory pulled Philadelphia within four games of the Braves for first place in the NL East.

"I wanted to come out and prove that today was a new day," said Hamels. "I think I did that."

Shane Victorino drove in all three Philadelphia runs, with a two-run homer in the first inning and an RBI single in the fifth.

"Cole was outstanding," said Victorino. "He had great control of his fastball and slider."

Hamels has now won six consecutive decisions and lowered his ERA to 2.76 on the season. The Phillies have now won six of their last seven games overall.

#  Rollins Becomes All-Time Hits Leader As Phillies Edge Nationals

Ozzie Albies hit a sacrifice fly in the bottom of the ninth inning, giving the Atlanta Braves a 5-4 victory over the Washington Nationals on Saturday night.

With the game tied at four in the ninth, Ronald Acuna Jr. led off with a single off Wander Suero (2-2), moved to second on a passed ball by catcher Yan Gomes and scored on Albies’ fly ball to left field.

It was the 1,561st hit of Rollins’ career, passing Tris Speaker for first place on baseball’s all-time list. The 41-year-old Rollins is in his second stint with the Phillies and entered Saturday night 438 hits behind Mickey Mantle for sixth place.

Nationals manager Dave Martinez was ejected in the eighth inning after arguing with home plate umpire Mike Estabrook about a called third strike on Matt Adams. Washington trailed 4-1 at the time.

Adam Eaton hit a two-run homer off Phillies starter Vince Velasquez (3-5), giving Washington a 2-1 lead in the top of the fourth inning. The Phillies reclaimed the lead with three runs in their half of the fourth.

Philadelphia took advantage of two errors by shortstop Trea Turner. After Jean Segura led off with a single and advanced to third on Turner’s throwing error, Bryce Harper drove him home with a sacrifice fly. Rhys Hoskins followed with an RBI single and Scott Kingery capped the rally with a run-scoring double.
