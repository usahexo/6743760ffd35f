#  Atlantic City Casinos Offer Sports Betting to Pound Players 

Since the early days of Atlantic City gambling, sports betting has been a big attraction. Now, with New Jersey’s recent legalization of sports betting, casinos in Atlantic City are getting in on the action.

The Borgata, Caesars, Golden Nugget, and Ocean Resort casinos have all started taking sports bets. And Resorts Casino Hotel is scheduled to start accepting sports bets on July 30.

At the Borgata, there’s a huge screen broadcasting all the games, and bettors can place their wagers at kiosks or from their phones.

The Golden Nugget is also offering an app for sports betting. And at Caesars, you can place your bets at one of four kiosks or use the app.

Ocean Resort is also using an app for sports betting. But Resorts will be using a different app that will be provided by William Hill US, which is the stadium bookmaker for Monmouth Park Racetrack.

There are many options for placing bets at all of these casinos. You can bet on who will win or lose a game, how many points they will win by, or which player will score first. There are also prop bets available on things like how many field goals will be made in a game or whether there will be a penalty called.

So if you’re in Atlantic City and you want to bet on the game, there’s no need to go to a bookmaker outside of town. Just head to one of the casinos and place your bet!

#  Atlantic City Casinos Welcomes UK Pound Sports Bettors 

Atlantic City welcomes UK pound sports bettors with open arms, as the gaming industry in New Jersey continues to grow. AC Casinos are seeing a rise in visitation since New Jersey legalized sports betting in June, and they anticipate that trend to continue as the NFL and college football seasons heat up.

It’s no secret that Atlantic City has been struggling in recent years, but the legalization of sports betting is proving to be a saving grace for the city’s casinos. Not only are they generating new revenue from sports bets, but they’re also attracting more visitors who are interested in placing bets.

The Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa has seen the biggest increase in visitation, with a 12% jump in July compared to the same month last year. The Tropicana Casino and Resort experienced an 11% increase, and Caesars Atlantic City saw a 10% increase. Overall, casino visitation is up by 7% compared to last year.

Atlantic City’s casinos aren’t the only ones benefiting from the legalization of sports betting; online gambling companies are seeing a surge in interest as well. Caesars Entertainment Corporation (CEOC), which owns online gambling site CaesarsCasino.com, said that its third-quarter earnings were boosted by an increase in registered users and total wagers on U.S. sports events.

The growth of the gaming industry is good news for Atlantic City taxpayers, as it helps to offset some of the financial losses that the city has been experiencing. It’s also good news for employees of the casinos, many of whom were facing layoffs before sports betting was legalized.

#  Atlantic City's Casinos Now Offering Sports Betting in British Pounds 

Atlantic City's casinos are now offering sports betting in British pounds. Bettors will be able to place their bets at the Borgata, Golden Nugget, Harrah's, Ocean Resort, and Tropicana.

The decision to offer sports betting in British pounds was made in order to make the experience more convenient for international visitors. Now, bettors will not have to convert their currency in order to place a wager.

"We're excited to offer sports betting in British pounds as we continue to grow our global player base," said Jim Ryan, CEO of Caesars Entertainment. "This new offering furthers our commitment to providing the best possible gaming experience for our guests."

 It is yet unknown how popular this new offering will be among Atlantic City's casino goers. However, with the ever-increasing popularity of legalized sports betting across the United States, it is likely that this move will be successful.

#  Atlantic City Casinos Adds Sports Betting for Euros, Pound and Other Currencies 

Atlantic City casinos, who have been battling to keep their gaming industry afloat, are now looking to sports betting as a potential new revenue stream.

The Borgata, Caesars and Golden Nugget announced that they would start taking sports bets in euros, pounds and other currencies on Tuesday. Previously, they could only take sports bets in U.S. currency.

It's the latest effort by Atlantic City casinos to attract more customers as they face increasing competition from casinos in neighboring states. Pennsylvania, New York and Delaware all offer more gambling options than New Jersey.

"This is an important day for Atlantic City," said Tony Rodio, president of Tropicana Entertainment and head of the Casino Association of New Jersey. "Today's action demonstrates our ability to compete with any casino jurisdiction in the world."

Last week, The Borgata became the first casino in Atlantic City to offer online gambling for people living in New Jersey.

#  Atlantic City casinos add sports betting for pesos, loonies and more

Atlantic City casinos are now taking bets on sports games in a variety of currencies, including Canadian pesos and Mexican loonies.

"We're seeing a lot of interest from our guests in betting on sports games, so we wanted to give them more options when it comes to currency," said an Atlantic City casino spokesperson.

Sports betting is already popular in Las Vegas, with people using U.S. dollars to make their bets. But with the soaring value of the dollar against other currencies, many casinos are offering alternatives for those who want to bet on sports games.

"There's been a lot of discussion about the dollar lately, so we think this will be a popular option for our guests," said the spokesperson.

Casinos in Atlantic City are also taking bets in euros and British pounds, as well as other currencies.
