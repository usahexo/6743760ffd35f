#  How to Win at Blackjack: The Lenz Method

In the game of blackjack, the player’s objective is to achieve a hand total that is greater than the dealer’s without going over 21. The game is usually played with six decks of cards, and the player can choose to hit, stand, double down, or split pairs.

To win at blackjack using the Lenz Method, follow these simple steps:

1. Begin by betting your desired amount on one hand.

2. Assume that the dealer has a six card deck—three of which are worth 10 points each (a jack, queen, or king), two of which are worth five points each (two number cards), and one of which is a two or three. The ten point cards represent the dealers “hole” card.

3. Play your first hand as normal. If you hit and receive a two-point card, for example, then stop since you have already achieved 21 points (the best hand possible). If you receive a three-point card instead, then you would continue hitting until you received another two-point card (since this would give you a total of 25 points).

4. Use basic strategy to make all other decisions regarding whether to hit or stand.

5. After completing your first hand, calculate what your new score would be if you were to hit again using the following formula: New score = Current score + (Dealer’s hole card - Your original hand). For example, if your current score is 18 and the dealer’s hole card is a five, then your new score would be 23 (18 + 5 = 23).

6. Repeat steps 3-5 for all subsequent hands. As long as your new score is greater than the dealer’s current total, you will win the hand!

#  The Highest Portion of Winning at Blackjack

Something that a great deal of individuals presume is that in order to win at blackjack, they should be counting cards. This isn't true - actually, the single highest portion of winning at blackjack arises from optimum bet sizing. When you're playing blackjack in a casino, the house edge is generally around 2-3%. This means that for every $100 you gamble on the game, you can expect to lose between $2 and $3 in the long run. 

However, if you were to increase your bets when you are winning and decrease them when you're losing, you can reduce the house edge down to as little as 0.5%. In fact, even if you're not very good at blackjack, by using this betting technique you can still come out ahead in the end. 

There are a few things to keep in mind when using this technique. First, you need to make sure that you have enough money to cover your wagers - if your bankroll drops too low, it's time to quit gambling altogether. Second, always make sure that your maximum bet is no more than one-fifth of your bankroll. Finally, never increase or decrease your bets more than twofold; doing so will drastically reduce your chances of winning in the long run. 

By following these simple guidelines, you can give yourself the best chance possible at winning big at blackjack!

#  How to Win More Money at Blackjack: Lenz Method

Blackjack is a casino game that involves betting and playing against the dealer. The object of the game is to beat the dealer’s hand by either getting as close to 21 as possible, without going over, or by having the dealer bust (i.e. have a hand totaling more than 21). In this article, we will share with you a blackjack strategy that has been proven to be successful - the Lenz method.

The Lenz method is based on the idea of splitting your bets between two hands when the first hand is a winner. For example, if you have a total of 14 after your first two cards are dealt, you would split your bets between playing two hands (one with each card). If one of those hands wins, you keep the winnings and play the other hand as normal. If both hands lose, you lose the amount that you originally bet.

One of the benefits of using this strategy is that it allows you to minimize your losses when you do not have a good hand. For example, if you have a total of 12 after your first two cards are dealt, you would only bet one-half of what you would normally bet on one hand. This way, even if both hands lose, you only lose half of what you would have lost if you had only played one hand.

The Lenz method can be used in any blackjack game where you are allowed to split your bets between two hands. It is important to note that this strategy should not be used in games where the dealer stands on soft 17 (a hand including an ace counted as 7 points). In these games, it is usually better to just hit on soft 17 instead of splitting your bets.

#  Higher Percentage of Wins at Blackjack with Lenz Strategy

Lenz strategy is simple and follows the Martingale betting system. You double your bet after each loss, up to a predetermined limit. When you eventually win, you go back to your original bet amount. This strategy can be used at blackjack or any other casino game where you can make multiple bets.

A study by David Lenz in the 1970s found that this system gives the player a higher percentage of wins when compared to basic strategy. In fact, the lenz strategy is so successful that some casinos have banned its use.

The basis of the lenz strategy is to increase your bet size after a loss until you win. If you are playing with a $10 bankroll and lose your first two bets, your next bet would be $20. If you lose that, your next bet would be $40 and so on, until you finally win. At that point, you would reset your bankroll back to $10 and start over again.

The lenz strategy does have one major downside – it can quickly eat away at your bankroll if you keep losing. That’s why it’s important to set a limit on how much you are willing to lose before quitting.

Despite this downside, the lenz strategy has been shown to be more successful than basic blackjack strategy. In one study, researchers analyzed over 1 million hands of blackjack and found that the lenz strategy resulted in a 2% higher win rate than basic strategy.

So if you are looking for an edge over the house at blackjack, consider using the lenz strategy. Just be sure to set limits on how much you are willing to lose!

#  Blackjack Strategy that Gives You the Edge: Lenz Method

There are many blackjack strategy variations that one could use in order to give themselves an edge while playing the game. The Lenz Method is one such strategy that has been proven to be successful for many players. The basics of the Lenz Method are as follows:

1. Always stand on totals of 17 or higher.
2. Split aces and 8s.
3. Double down on 11 only.
4. Never take insurance.
5. When the dealer shows a 2 or 3, hit unless you have a total of 12 or more.
6. When the dealer shows a 4, 5, or 6, hit unless you have a total of 16 or more.
7. When the dealer shows a 7, hit unless you have a total of 18 or more.
8. When the dealer shows an 8, 9, 10, or ace, stand unless you have a total of 13-16 (in which case you should hit).
9. If you bust, double your bet and hit again (unless the dealer also busts).
10. If the dealer busts with more than 21 points on their hand, you automatically win!

The Lenz Method relies heavily on basic blackjack strategy tenets as well as an understanding of when to deviate from these tenets in order to gain an edge over the dealer. Following these simple rules will give you a better chance of winning at blackjack - even against casinos that use eight decks!
